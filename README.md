Do you thinking to make mini temperature sensor circuit at home? But you don’t have any ideas about making a cheap and simple temperature sensor circuit.
Then this project is only for you

Today we’ll use two electronics component to test the temperature sensor circuit. We use rectifier diode and thermistor (TTC-103).
We also need any more electronics component to make this circuit.


To make diode sensor circuit we need – 

1. Transistor – BC 547 *2
2. Resistor – 1 MΩ
     220 Ω
3. Diode – 1N 4007
4. Buzzer
5. Battery – 3.7v


Circuit Connection – 

To make diode sensor circuit 1st we connect 1 transistor “Emitter” with other transistor “Base”. Then we connect both transistor “Collector” and connect 220 Ω resistor with “Collector”. Now we connect rectifier diode with the circuit. Connect diode negative leg with empty terminal of 220 Ω resistor and diode positive leg with “Base”.
Now we connect buzzer with the circuit. We connect buzzer positive leg with “Emitter”. Then we connect 1 MΩ resistor with the circuit. We connect resistor with diode positive leg and buzzer negative leg.
Now, we connect power source with the circuit. You know, for power source we are using DC - 3.7 volt battery. Connect DC positive cable with “Collector” of transistor and DC negative cable with buzzer negative leg.

Our circuit is now ready for use. Now we just heat on the diode, if we hear the buzzer sound then we try to cold the diode and then the buzzer sound will be off.
Following this method, we can easily make diode control temperature sensor circuit at home easily.


To make Thermistor sensor circuit we need – 

1. Transistor – BC 547
2. Resistor – 1 KΩ
3. LED – 3.7v
4. Thermistor (TTC) - 103
5. Battery – 3.7v


Circuit Connection – 

To make thermistor sensor circuit, 1st we connect 1 KΩ resistor with “Base” & “Emitter” of transistor.
Now we connect LED negative leg with “Collector” of transistor. Now we connect thermistor with the circuit. 
Connect thermistor with “Base” of transistor and other terminal with positive leg of LED.

Now we connect power source with the circuit. For power source we are using DC - 3.7 volt battery.
Connect battery positive cable with positive leg of LED and connect battery negative cable with “Emitter” of transistor. 
Our circuit is now ready for use. Now we just heat on the thermistor, if we see that LED light glowing  then we try to cold the thermistor and then the LED light will be off.
Following this method, we can easily make thermistor control temperature sensor circuit at home easily.
